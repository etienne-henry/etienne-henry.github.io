#### Migratory landbirds conservation {.test}

##### PhD candidate  {.test}

\
My current work focuses on the conservation of African-Eurasian migratory landbirds. The persistent decline in migratory bird populations observed over recent decades highlights the urgent need to improve our scientific understanding of the factors driving this trend.\
My research employs a diverse range of methodologies, including:

-   Analyzing **tracking data** from long-distance terrestrial migrants, including storks, raptors, and landbirds, to evaluate their exposure to different  threats throughout their migratory cycle.

-   **Modelling** recent changes in migratory bird communities and projecting future trends in the context of global anthropogenic change.
