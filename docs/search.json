    "text": "Migratory landbirds conservation\n\nPhD candidate\n\nMy current work focuses on the conservation of African-Eurasian migratory landbirds. The persistent decline in migratory bird populations observed over recent decades highlights the urgent need to improve our scientific understanding of the factors driving this trend.\nMy research employs a diverse range of methodologies, including:\n\nAnalyzing tracking data from long-distance terrestrial migrants, including storks, raptors, and landbirds, to evaluate their exposure to different threats throughout their migratory cycle.\nModelling recent changes in migratory bird communities and projecting future trends in the context of global anthropogenic change."

Consequently, a decline observed in any given population may reflect stress factors from the breeding grounds (e.g. agricultural intensification3) or be indicative of threats faced by the birds in other regions and at a different time (e.g. hunting during migration4 or extreme climate conditions in the non-breeding grounds5).\nAdvances in tracking technologies allowed unprecedented insights on the annual cycle, connectivity patterns, and migratory strategies of many Afro-Palearctic migratory birds6. Combining tracking data from multiple populations and species can allows us to contrast individuals, species and populations in terms of their exposure to different threats.\nThis PhD project draws on a dataset covering the movements of thousands of individuals spanning 45 African-Eurasian migratory species. This dataset is the result of the collaboration of more than 172 contributors and the invaluable work of João Guilherme, who compiled and standardised all the different tracking data.\n\nHow are migration patterns along the African-Eurasian flyway predicted to change in response to ongoing threats (climate change, land-use change…)?\n\nIn collaboration with Marius Somveille.\n\nLet’s see how it gows\n\n\n\nPrevious research\n\n2nd year Master’s thesis: Modeling the probability of meeting IUCN Red List criteria to support reassessmentsUnder the supervision of Victor Cazalis (iDiv, Germany), Moreno Di Marco & Luca Santini (Sapienza University)\n1st year Master thesis: Map the transfer of knowledge through citizen sciences: case study of amphibians on iNaturalist Under the supervision of Ana Rodrigues & Marie-Morgane Rouyer (CEFE, Montepellier)"
