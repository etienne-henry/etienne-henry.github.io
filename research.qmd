## PhD outline

**Supervisors**: [Ana Rodrigues](https://www.cefe.cnrs.fr/fr/recherche/bc/dpb/862-c/228-ana-rodrigues) (CEFE - CNRS, Montpellier) & [Inês Catry](https://cibio.up.pt/en/people/details/ines-catry/) (CIBIO - University of Porto).\
Project in collaboration with [BirdLife International](https://www.birdlife.org/).

The project results from collaboration between the CEFE, the [CIBIO](https://cibio.up.pt/en/) and [BirdLife International](https://www.birdlife.org/).

My PhD research project aims to address the 3 following questions:

1.  What are the drivers behind the decline of African-Eurasian migratory landbird populations?

The decline in African-Eurasian migrant populations [@vickery_conservation_2023], may result from cumulative exposure to various spatially and temporally distinct threats [@buchan_spatially_2022]. Consequently, a decline observed in any given population may reflect stress factors from the breeding grounds (e.g. agricultural intensification [@rigal_farmland_2023]) or be indicative of threats faced by the birds in other regions and at a different time (e.g. hunting during migration [@brochet_preliminary_2016] or extreme climate conditions in the non-breeding grounds [@preston-allen_geography_2023]).\
Advances in tracking technologies allowed unprecedented insights on the annual cycle, connectivity patterns, and migratory strategies of many African-Eurasian migratory birds [@hewson_population_2016]. Combining tracking data from multiple populations and species can allows us to contrast individuals, species and populations in terms of their exposure to different threats.

This PhD project draws on a dataset covering the movements of thousands of individuals spanning 45 African-Eurasian migratory species. This dataset is the result of the collaboration of more than 172 contributors and the invaluable work of **João Guilherme**, who compiled and standardised all the different tracking data @fig-track.

2.  How are migration patterns along the African-Eurasian flyway predicted to change in response to ongoing threats (climate change, land-use change...)?
