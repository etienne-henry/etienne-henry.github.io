## PhD outline

My PhD research focuses on the conservation of African-Eurasian migratory terrestrial birds. I am based in the [CEFE](https://www.cefe.cnrs.fr/en/), Montpellier, France. The project is supervised by [Ana Rodrigues](https://www.cefe.cnrs.fr/fr/recherche/bc/dpb/862-c/228-ana-rodrigues) (CEFE - CNRS, Montpellier) & [Inês Catry](https://cibio.up.pt/en/people/details/ines-catry/) (CIBIO - University of Porto) and in collaboration with [BirdLife International](https://www.birdlife.org/), England.

The project aims to address the 3 following questions:

##### 1. What are the drivers behind the decline of African-Eurasian migratory landbird populations?

The decline in African-Eurasian migrant populations [@vickery_conservation_2023] may result from cumulative exposure to various spatially and temporally distinct threats [@buchan_spatially_2022]. Consequently, a decline observed in any given population may reflect stress factors from the breeding grounds (e.g. agricultural intensification [@rigal_farmland_2023]) or be indicative of threats faced by the birds in other regions and at a different time (e.g. hunting during migration [@brochet_preliminary_2016] or extreme climate conditions in the non-breeding grounds [@preston-allen_geography_2023]).
 
Advances in tracking technologies allowed unprecedented insights on the annual cycle [@bridge_technology_2011], connectivity patterns, and migratory strategies [@hewson_population_2016] of many African-Eurasian migratory birds. Combining tracking data from multiple populations and species can allows us to contrast individuals, species and populations in terms of their exposure to different threats, e.g, GPS track from German and X storks @fig-track.

Tracks of three White Storks (*Ciconia ciconia*) during their annual migration. Each color represents an individual, with data points sub-sampled to one per day for computational efficiency.

European Roller (*Coracias garrulus*) captured during its breeding season in Portugal (May 2024). Tracking devices revealed that these individuals migrate to southern Africa for the non-breeding season [@catry_unravelling_2014].

This PhD project draws on a unique dataset covering the movements of thousands of individuals from 45 African-Eurasian migratory bird species, spanning a wide range of body sizes (from small warblers to large storks) and ecological groups, including passerines, near-passerines, storks, and raptors. This dataset is the result of the collaboration of more than 172 contributors and the invaluable work of [João Guilherme](https://4vultures.org/about-us/meet-the-team/joao-guilherme/) who compiled and standardised all the different tracking data [@guilherme_informing_2022].

##### 2. How are migration patterns along the African-Eurasian flyway predicted to change in response to ongoing threats (climate change and land-use change)?

This analysis will combine scenarios of future change with macro-ecological models of bird migration to predict the response of bird migration patterns across the African-Eurasian flyway to anthropogenic change. Specifically, it will rely on the Optimal Redistribution Simulator (ORSIM), a mechanistic model developed by Somveille et al. [@somveille_general_2021]. The ORSIM is a mechanistic model that simulates an optimal redistribution of individuals between breeding and wintering areas building from first ecological (i.e., competition) and energetic principles and we will use it to explore how the African-Eurasian migratory system will respond to the general predicted large-scale changes in climate first, then landuse. In particular, it will explore spatio-temporal changes in migratory distances in context of global changes. Using this model, we aim to assess the impacts of large-scale climate change and land-use changes on the African-Eurasian migratory system, with a particular focus on spatio-temporal shifts in migratory distances.

##### 3. What are the priority actions for the conservation of African-Eurasian migratory landbirds at the flyway scale?

This final part will draw from the previous results to, first, identify populations or species of Afro-Eurasian migratory birds that are most at risk from ongoing as well as future change; and, second, to explore scenarios via the ORSIM model to test whether targeted conservation intervention (e.g., habitat protection, restrictions to hunting) can have a disproportionately positive effect on the conservation prospects of these species. We will use these results to inform international cooperation efforts under the United Nations Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals (CMS, 1979), specifically its daughter agreements that promote international coordination and guide decision-makers along the African-Eurasian flyway: the The African-Eurasian Migratory Landbirds Action Plan (AEMLAP) and the Memorandum of Understanding on the Conservation of Migratory Birds of Prey in Africa and Eurasia (Raptors MOU),
